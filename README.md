Predicting Parkinson's Disease using Machine Learning
Parkinson disease (PD) is a universal public health problem of massive measurement. Machine learning based method is used to classify between healthy people and people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). This paper presents a comprehensive review for the prediction of Parkinson disease buy using machine learning based approaches. The brief introduction of various computational intelligence techniques-based approaches used for the prediction of Parkinson diseases are presented. This paper also presents the summary of results obtained by various researchers available in literature to predict the Parkinson diseases.
